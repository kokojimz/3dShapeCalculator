## About 
3D shape calculator app for Android that allows users to calculate the volume of various geometric shapes such as spheres, cubes, and pyramids. This app is developed using Android Studio and Java, providing a simple yet functional interface. Each geometric shape has its own fragment where users can input relevant dimensions (like radius, side length, or height) through EditText, and by pressing a button, the calculated volume is displayed.
